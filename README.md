Symfony Standard Edition Bundle
===============================

This bundle was originally created to hold as much of the base logic / functionality of [Symfony Standard Edition](https://github.com/symfony/symfony-standard) as reasonable to allow it to be used by a more abstracted and minimal equivalent of the Standard Edition.  As the Symfony project has moved to make upgrading versions much simpler, this project has become mostly a container for a lot of the repeated stuff I would otherwise have in my Symfony projects.  This transition is still in progress and things will be removed and added.

To use, you can add [`tjm/symfony-standard-edition-bundle`](https://packagist.org/packages/tjm/symfony-standard-edition-bundle) to your 'composer.json'.  See [my site's code repo](https://github.com/tobymackenzie/site-tobymackenzie.com) for example usage.
