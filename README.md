Symfony Web
===========

Base classes / functionality on top of Symfony components for creating a Symfony based web project.

This bundle was originally created to hold as much of the base logic / functionality of [Symfony Standard Edition](https://github.com/symfony/symfony-standard) as reasonable to allow it to be used by a more abstracted and minimal equivalent of the Standard Edition.  As the Symfony project has moved to make upgrading versions much simpler, this project has become mostly a container for a lot of the repeated stuff I would otherwise have in my Symfony projects.  This transition is still in progress and things will be removed and added.
